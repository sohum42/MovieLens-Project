# MovieLens-Project
The MovieLens dataset contains roughly 10 million ratings of movies, provided by 100,000 users. The goal
of this project is to predict the ratings that a user will give to movies they have not yet rated. We start
by exploring the variables in the dataset, such as the distribution of the ratings and which movies have
been rated the most. After the initial analysis, we start building a dataset to predict ratings for. We create
a dataset of users with movies they have not rated, and through machine learning approaches, we aim to
predict the ratings the users will provide.
